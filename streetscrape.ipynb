      "84 Many thanks go to Khalil Cumberbatch, Robin McGinty, Joyce McMillan, Johnny Perez, and Roy Waterman for contributing their eloquent words. The profiles included in this edition showcase the incredible strength and grace of five people, but they represent the spirit of many more. We are so grateful that this brilliant group of people shared their experiences with us and all of our readers.\n",
      "85 We are so proud to showcase the artwork of five currently incarcerated artists. Our beautiful cover was illustrated by A.S. and you will find more excellent work throughout this book. We truly appreciate everyone who entered our cover art contest in its inaugural year. We hope that you inspire other artists to reach out and share their work.\n",

      "88 Much support and learning is always gained from NYPL’s affiliation with the New York Reentry Education Network. We are appreciative of the many people who participated in discussions to improve Connections and make it more useful, especially those who wrote to us from prisons with their feedback. Many thanks go to the Library’s Creative Services team for their support and hard work. A huge thanks to the BookOps and Logistics teams who are responsible for its distribution.\n",

      "90 History\n",
      "91 Connections was first created in 1982 by Steve Likosky, The New York Public Library’s first correctional services librarian. The first edition was a list of resources 42 pages long. Today Connections lists over 500 agencies and services, reflecting the network of reentry support in New York City as it has grown and evolved.\n",
      "92 In 1982, the total US incarcerated population was 500,000. Today there are almost 7 million adults incarcerated or under correctional control such as probation or parole. Another nearly 2 million juveniles are incarcerated or court involved. Every community is affected by incarceration—personally, collectively, financially, and ethically.\n",
      "93 People returning home to New York City have an amazing wealth of resources to ease the strain of justice involvement and rebuild healthy paths. Accessing those resources can be overwhelming, but also life- changing. We hope Connections is a trustworthy place to start.\n",

In the beginning, I could not fathom doing so much time, but after a few years I managed to get a routine down and began to see my environment and my sentence as an opportunity to learn about myself, the world, and the people who live in it.

      "179 After 12 years, 10 months, and a few hours, the Department of Corrections released me into a world that had become foreign to me. The world was a different place than the one I remembered. I stared at the cartoon characters in Times Square and laughed. Touchscreen phones were a puzzle to me. The prices of food were inflated beyond\n",

      "181 Volunteering was a great way to get my foot in the door of an agency without them taking the “risk” of hiring me. What I would lose in salary, I would gain in rapport and access to people who were in a position to hire me one day. So I volunteered at the Police Athletic League in Harlem where I shared my experience of incarceration with teenagers who were just like me at that age. It was rewarding, and led to speaking opportunities where I approached the audience as if I was facilitating a class in prison.\n",
      "182 I took advantage of anything and everything I was eligible for. The Connections book served as an information guide to agencies I never knew existed. I applied for public assistance and food stamps as soon as I was released. I applied for rental assistance so that I could help my mother while I lived in her living room. Eventually I asked\n",

So I tell you, you are stronger than you think you are and more resilient than most people out here. What separates us, and gives us an edge, is that we know what it feels to have nothing and to come face to face with unimaginable adversity that we have normal- ized. Box time, for example.

This is a walk in the park.” I would say to myself out loud with deep conviction. Weeks later, a person I met through my volunteer work at PAL forwarded me a job opening at a law firm that was looking to hire someone to help people who are returning home from prison. I submitted my resume and a cover letter describ- ing my experience with incarceration and how I am the best person  to help someone with reentry. You can only imagine my happiness when I was called in for an interview, then called back for a second one, and was eventually hired.\n",
